                <h4>GENERAL TERMS</h4>

                <p> 
                    We reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue the Service at our sole discretion, at any time, for any or no reason, and without notice or liability.
                </p>

                <p>

                    The Terms, and any rights or obligations hereunder, are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with AppBeware’s prior written consent, but may be assigned or transferred by us without restriction.
